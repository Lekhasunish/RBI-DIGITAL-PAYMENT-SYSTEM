## 📊 Project Overview
**Problem:**
* Comparison of RBI multiple digital payment systems
* To understand RBI’s role in digital payments
* To study major digital payment systems regulated by RBI
* To analyze the growth and adoption of digital payments

## 💡 Key Findings
* UPI dominates both transaction volume and transaction frequency.
* RTGS records significantly lower transaction counts but much higher transaction values, indicating its primary use for high-value fund transfers.
* RTGS and UPI transactions are higher than card transactions.
* Reserve Bank of India plays a central regulatory and supervisory role in ensuring the smooth functioning of digital payment systems.
* It depends on whether you’re looking at volume or value:                              
  Volume: UPI > IMPS > Cards >> RTGS                                        
  Value: RTGS > UPI > Cards
* The major digital payment systems observed in the dataset include UPI, RTGS, card payment systems and AEPS.
Each system serves a distinct functional purpose:
 * UPI primarily supports everyday person-to-person and merchant payments.
 * RTGS is mainly used for high-value and time-critical transfers.
 * Card payment systems are largely associated with retail and merchant transactions.
 * AEPS supports basic banking and inclusion-oriented services.
 * Trend and distribution analysis indicate a consistent and strong growth in digital payment usage, especially for UPI.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* Jupyter Notebook - Analysis 
* Python - Programming language

* Pandas - Data manipulation

## 📌 Recommendations
🔹 Strengthen UPI infrastructure and capacity.                                        
🔹 Promote balanced growth of other digital payment systems.                                       
🔹 Enhance cybersecurity and fraud monitoring mechanisms.                                               
🔹 Improve digital literacy and customer awareness.                         
🔹 Support innovation in payment systems.    

## 🔚 Conclusion
Overall, the results confirm that digital payments in India are increasingly driven by UPI, reflecting changing consumer behaviour, higher smartphone penetration and strong institutional support from RBI.
